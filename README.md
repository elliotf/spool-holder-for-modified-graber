This is a spool holder for my modified graber i3 derivative printer.  Instead of having the z brace sides angled, I made them square and straight.  This spool holder fits on top (similar to a mendel90.)

The guide retainer is meant to hold some random HDPE tubing I got at the hardware store.  It goes from the spool to the extruder (my geared NEMA14 3mm extruder) to avoid any drag on the X carriage.
